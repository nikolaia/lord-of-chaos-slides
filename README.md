# Lord of Chaos - Becoming a Chaos Engineer

Presentation held at Javazone 2016

## Abstract

Our software systems are becoming more complex and more distributed. How do we have confidence in the resilience and redundancy of the systems we put in production? Chaos Engineering is the practice of introducing failures into your system in controlled experiments to learn how your system reacts. In this talk we will look into how to establish the steady state behavior of a system and how to start experimenting to discover if the system can handle spikes in traffic, failures and timeouts.
